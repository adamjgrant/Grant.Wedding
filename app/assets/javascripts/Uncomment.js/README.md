# Uncomment.js
An enormous JS library you can use in projects, uncommenting only what you need.

Uncomment.js is essentially an alphabetized list of basic functions to be used for functional programming.
Similar to Underscore.js, you can keep your code tidy and self-documenting by using functions for each individual task your program needs
to do.

However, instead of using the whole library like underscore.js, you can keep your code small as well by only uncommenting
what you need. By default, all of uncomment.js is commented out.
